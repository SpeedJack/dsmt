\begin{description}
	\item[Agent detail page] If you are the owner of the selected object,
		you will see on the left your auction information, the momentary
		total gain and objects sold (they will become definitive at the

		winning offers. All is shown in \figref{fig:detail-seller}. To
		delete the auction, you can press the button ``Delete Auction''.
	\item[Bidder detail page] If you are a customer you will see, as in
		\figref{fig:detail-customer}, the general auction information
		and the minimum bid to momentary win the quantity of objects you
		prefer.  On the right side you can bid, inserting the offer and
		the desired number of objects. Then, you have to press the
		button ``Send Bid''.  If all is done correctly, you will see if
		your offer is momentary a winning one or not, as shown in
		\figref{fig:bid}. The bid status is updated real time. If you
		see false in the column ``is winning'', this means that to win
		you have to do another bid. You can delete your bid pressing the
		button ``Delete'', on the row with the offer to cancel. At the
