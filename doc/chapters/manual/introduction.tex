\section{Introduction}

DistributedAuctionSystem (DAS) is an application used to create online auctions
and participate in them.

Every user can  put items up for sale through auctions and can try to buy items
by bidding in available auctions.

Any user who wants to buy items can act as a bidder and can scroll through the
list of available auctions, select an auction he is interested in to see
information, make bids and follow the progress of auctions in real time.

Any user who wants to sell items can act as an agent and has the ability to
create new auctions and follow the progress of his current auctions.

All these features are made available to the user through a web interface that
provides a simple and intuitive graphic interface.
