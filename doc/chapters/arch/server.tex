\section{Application server}\label{sec:archserver}

The application server provides the management of the user interface for the web
client thanks to the use of servlets that exploit the JSP technology, and it
manages the business logic using the JakartaEE framework that allows it to
communicate with the Erlang subsystem. Furthermore, given the purpose of the
application, the application server implements an asynchronous communication
system with the web clients, which allows users to receive real time updates on
the status of the auctions, using the Websocket communication protocol.

\figref{fig:application-server-arch} shows the application server's
architecture.
