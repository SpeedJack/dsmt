\subsection{Dispatchers}\label{subsec:archdispatchers}

Dispatchers are a set of Erlang processes which have the task of interfacing
with the application server. The task of a dispatcher is to assign the
management of an auction to a cluster executor when an auction creation request
arrives from the application server and subsequently forward the requests for
that auction to the same executor cluster. The assignment of the auction to the
cluster is done through a calculation between the id of the auction and the id
of the cluster, for this reason every dispatcher knows where to forward the
requests without the need for any kind of communication between them. Whenever
the application server has a request for the Erlang subsystem, it sends it to a
dispatcher which will forward the request to the cluster executor managing that
auction. Once the response from the cluster executor is received, the dispatcher
will forward the response to the application server. Dispatchers are implemented
through the \code{gen\_server} behavior.
