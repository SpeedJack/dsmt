\section{Web Client}\label{sec:web_client}

The web client allows users to interact with the application. It just reads the
input from the user from which builds http requests for the application server
and send them out. When the server responds, the web client shows the results to
the user and waits for new input. The web interface provides an intuitive and
easy to use graphical interface where the user can scroll through lists, select
items and fill forms.
