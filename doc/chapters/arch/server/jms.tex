\subsection{JMS and message driven beans}\label{subsec:archjms}

JMS and message driven beans provide the messaging framework for bids
dispatching from Erlang subsystem for notifying changes in auctionsâ€™ state to
clients. It is composed of the following components:

\begin{description}
	\item[JMS queue] a queue is used in order to asynchronously notify
		clients of changes in the auction state.
	\item[BidReceiver] Is a message-driven bean that receives the new state
		of the auctions from the queue and using Websocket
		ClientEndpoint API initiates the communication towards a
		Websocket ServerEndpoint. Then the ServerEndpoint communicate to
		the clients the updates.
