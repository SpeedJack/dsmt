\subsection{Websocket}\label{subsec:archwebsocket}

It be used as communication protocol among JEE beans and web clients. The web
server acts as a relay, providing two endpoints: one from the application server
towards the web server, and the other from the web server towards the clients.

This protocol allows us to implement a real time notification broadcasting
service for all the clients interested in an auction in a clean way (no polling
is needed), giving us the possibility to initiate the communication from the
backend.
